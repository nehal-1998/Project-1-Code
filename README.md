# Project Title: Killed or Survived Data set

In this project, we analyze the "Killed or Survived" dataset, which provides information about road accidents over the years 2015 to 2018. The dataset includes details such as accident type, location, district, and more. We aim to understand patterns and trends in road accidents and explore factors contributing to accidents.

## Key Insights

### 1. Data Similarity

I started by examining the similarity between the four datasets for the years 2015 to 2018. While analyzing the column names, I identified discrepancies, such as misspelled column names. We addressed these issues to prepare the datasets for merging.

### 3: Total Vehicles by District
Next, I calculated the total number of vehicles involved in accidents in each district. This analysis revealed insights into the distribution of accidents across different districts, highlighting areas with higher accident rates.

### 3. Average Vehicles by Neighborhood
I determined the average number of vehicles involved in accidents in each neighborhood. This analysis provided insights into the neighborhoods most affected by accidents.

### 4. Data Analysis and Visualization
I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain further insights into the dataset. I visualized the frequency of accidents over a 24-hour period, analyzed the impact of speeding on accidents, and identified patterns in accident occurrence.

## Conclusion
After merging the data of the four years we have concluded the following things:
 
1. Waterfront Communities - The Island is one of the most accident-prone neighborhoods in Toronto.
2. The total number of vehicles in the street during the accident is the highest in Scarborough followed by Toronto and East York.
3. Guildwood Neighbourhood has the highest average number of vehicles in street.
4. The frequency of Accidents is high between 3 PM - 8 PM and then again spikes towards 12 AM at midnight.
5. Speeding alone is not a major reason for the accidents that happen in Canada.
